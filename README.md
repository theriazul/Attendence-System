# OOP Mini Project: Attendence-System
This repository contains a Simplified Attendance System developed using only Java. The project is designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, and file handling. The primary goal is to provide a straightforward and efficient way to manage student or employee attendance without relying on external libraries or complex frameworks.
